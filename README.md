# RustOS

A minimal micro-kernel OS targeting x86 architecture with text mode (VGA) output, hardware interrupts, demand paging, shared memory,
cooperative multitasking and embedded unit tests, I used 'bootimage' as a bootloader. I'm currently working on implementing processes to enable pre-emptive multitasking.
